We shuffled our feet to write Merry Christmas in snow. I found a fox, long-frozen into the ice, looking as though the spring had not left his step. I can hear the purest silence, interrupted only by the crunch of snow beneath my boots. At 27, I traveled back to enjoy the changing leaves, resuming the peace I‚Äôd found here as a child. I will always be grateful for this slice of heaven that introduced me to the warm embrace of the forest. I seek it often now.",

It has a [pretty nice trail system](https://www.ebparks.org/images/Parks/Redwood/Redwood-map-2250w-20181207.gif) where you can chain together lots of little trails into something meatier, and also branch out into the e.g. adjacent Anthony Chabot Regional Park.\n\nUsually I'll pick a single photo to share here and link the rest in the comments, but IDK if anyone looks at the comments, so I'm trying out this 'collage' format instead.\n\nAlso for some reason the upload('s compression algorithm?) is really crushing the blacks, both on reddit and imgur. Had to brighten the photos up substantially or else everything is a dark mess. Even then, there's a lot less detail resolvable in the shadows of the brightened photo than in the original exports (might have been better to brighten the original RAWs but who has time for that... incidentally, Capture One seems to export JPEGs much darker than what I see in-editor after a recent upgrade to the latest version... I remember fixing this once before but don't remember my solution -- any tips?)",

Safety gear is strongly recommended when hiking mountains with increased exposure.\n\nI was confident in my ability to safely hike this mountain at that time, otherwise I would not have done it. I was careful with every step I took, and every gust of wind I felt.\n\nAlso, I was using a GoPro with wide view enabled (or super wide, can't remember), so it looks more exposed in this video than it does to the naked eye.\n\nI encourage everyone to get out and enjoy the outdoors because it is a beautiful, wild, and wonderful place. But, I do not encourage going for a hike or climb that will put your life in serious danger, unless you have some safety equipment that you know how to use.  Thank you all again and stay safe!",

I laid in creeks, I sat every half mile to get my HR back to 120 (from 180s) but it didn't help. \n\nI ended up with heat stroke.  There is about 2 miles of hiking I don't remember at all before my brother made me stop, used my InReach to call for help, and I was given a free helicopter tour of the canyon courtesy of the Park EMTs. \n\nAfter some excellent care by really fantastic people, I'm back at the El Tovar having dinner and getting ready to stretch and get some rest. \n\nMy pride is hurt more than my body.

Lucky we were at the ER in 15. 2 liters of IV and on their feet. \n\nThe following might have gotten you as you were drinking:  one month after the above I did south rim to river to south rim in May (note I have done a dozen R2R or S2River2S) but started at 4:30am to stay below 90F at the bottom.  Having experienced the two life/hike changing incidents above I was sure to have enough water and drink it.  What happened to me was I pushed beyond my current fitness level to get past the devils corkscrew before it got to hot.  While I was drinking a lot my stomach shut down and at 3 mile house all that water I was ‚Äúdrinking‚Äù came back up.  So it wasn‚Äôt getting into my system. Luckily I had the shade of the shelter and spent an hour sipping water and then took it real slow.  So even drinking enough your gut can shut down on you.  \n\nMaybe you and I can go on a redemption trip!",

We went to showers that cost $1.50 for three minutes (in 1989) and had dinner at the Tovar Hotel. We then drove back to Sierra Vista. That was a hard day.

Knew it was dehydration, spent a few mins sucking down as much water/electrolytes as I could. Went away after 10-15 mins.  About an hour later, cramp in right leg. Knew that was a bad sign. About 6000 ft, first signs of altitude sickness, too. Stopped, hydrated, it went away. Then, both legs at same time. At which point, too far to go back down, can only keep going up.\n\nFirst 7 miles took 6 hours. The next 2.4 miles took almost 5 hours. Severe altitude sickness. The trail had been completely wiped out by shock pack rockslides. All that was left, was a near straight scramble up fallen rock, for 1500-200o vertical feet. Except, I could only do 100 ft at time, before nausea and dizziness became too much. I'd have to sit, for two to five minutes, until my head cleared. Then, scramble another 100 feet, and sit.   \n\n\nNever made the summit. All three of us decided to quit at 8400 ft, at the Tram station. Glad we did. A poor soul died a little farther up, towards the summit, that day. His body was covered by a thin blanket and some rocks. If I had seen that, in the depths of my worst altitude sickness, I might have panicked. \n\nI remember thinking \"Arrogant fuck, you(myself) forgot that Mother Nature wants to kill you, at any time\"",

            "title": "Mt Whitney Day Hike",
            "content": "On July 13th I found that there were 2 Mt Whitney Trail day permits remaining for July 26th - in the middle of my two weeks of vacation, none the less. What are the chances? Unfortunately, it was less than two weeks away, and I hadn't exactly been training for that kind of hike. I'd been planning on doing the Cactus to Clouds hike up San Jacinto from Palm Springs this fall, so I thought Mt Whitney would be a good training hike. (Only half joking.) Even if I didn't summit, the altitude would be great experience for the top of San Jacinto - which was originally one of my biggest concerns. \n\nI've done a bunch of day hikes around San Diego, but none higher than 6,000 ft, and none longer than 12 miles, so I knew there was a really good chance I wouldn't get to the top of Whitney. My brother is planning on doing the cactus to clouds hike with me this fall, so I managed to convince him to try Whitney with me, too. Unfortunately, with our schedules right before the 26th, neither of us got in any good last-minute training, and basically drove up to Lone Pine completely unprepared. \n\nOn Monday we managed to get a great camp site for three nights right by the creek in Whitney Portal - perfect. After setting up and getting lunch, we decided to try a short hike up to Lone Pine Lake - as high as you can go on the trail without a permit. Starting from our site at about 8,000ft, we were immediately sucking wind from the altitude change. (We both live effectively at sea level.) But after finding a good pace we managed to get to the lake without too much difficulty. And I have to say, the place is gorgeous. I hadn't been up to the Sierras before, and I'm certainly going to make a point to get back as much as I can now. \n\nTuesday was a decided rest day, so we drove south to Horseshoe meadows (at 10,000 ft.) to have lunch and lay around, but got bored and ended up walking through the ridiculously awesome meadows up there for a few hours. We had dinner in Lone Pine before going back up to Whitney Portal. And usually the white noise of the creek would have been enough to ensure a good night's sleep, but anticipation and other day-hikers leaving incredibly early meant we basically got no sleep that night.\n\nGetting up at 2:45 Wednesday morning to start at the trailhead at 3:15 seemed a good idea - early enough to give us a cushion if weather started to close in that afternoon. Hiking in the dark with a headlamp was something I hadn't done before, and it was pretty great. I'm glad we'd done the first few miles up to Lone Pine Lake on Monday, though. The new territory past the lake was still in complete dark when we got to it, however, and I could barely make out the looming rock faces or even Mirror Lake when we basically walked right by. \n\nWe felt pretty good when we stopped to rest past Bighorn Park for the first time around 6. A Clif bar and 15 minutes later and we carried on up to Trailside meadow and then trail camp. This last stretch before trail camp was starting to get really tough. With the sun fully up we could finally see the great views from above the tree line, which was one of the few positive points to counter our tired legs. \n\nAfter another fifteen minute break at trail camp to filter water and chew on some shot blocks, we started up the 97 switchbacks. At trail camp I couldn't tell where the trail went, but eventually picked out some really tiny hikers about halfway up to trail crest. I wanted to cry. I was tired, but not enough to warrant turning around at this point. It was only around 8, so we had plenty of time. The switchbacks were hellish to a point that I didn't think they would end. For the first time I started thinking that I physically might not be able to make it to Trail Crest - always my secret minimum allowable goal. Even with the knowledge that we really weren't physically prepared, the thought was sobering. Still, we managed to push on with more and more frequent breaks to reach trail crest around 9:30. For the first time you could see to the West, and into Sequoia national park. Breathtaking, to say the least, at 13,600ft. \n\nWe decided to push on, with the summit only about 2.5 miles away. How hard could it be? There were less than 1,000 vertical feet left (if you don't count the few hundred feet you have to descent from trail crest) and it would be easy, right? Holy crap wrong. At around 14,000ft and after nine or ten miles uphill, every rock over a foot tall was a challenge. From the crest to the John Muir trail and around the windows was arguably the coolest part of the hike if you like alpine views and awesomeness, but from the windows up was almost torture. You can see the top, but we were getting there so slowly!\n\nAfter winding around the back side you feel like you're basically there, but the last half to quarter mile was maybe even tougher, if only because we wanted to be there so badly but kept slowing down. Once the summit shack came into view, though, we knew we'd done it, rejoiced, and laid down to take a nap. I honestly could have slept for the entire hour we were up there, if it weren't for the excited chatter from all the other peppy, seemingly energetic hikers up there with us. I tried choking down another cliff bar, but just couldn't even smell it without feeling a bit ill. Surprisingly, I didn't feel any other ill effects from the altitude aside from fatigue, but that was probably partly due to a lack of sleep, and consuming only about four hundred calories in the previous 8.5 hours. (Endomondo estimated - probably badly - that it was a nearly 8,000 calorie hike, and it only counted 18 of the 22 total miles.)\n\nWe made it up in 8.5 hours, and down in 5.5. Not screwing around coming down. We wanted to be done. The slight up hill to trail crest from the John Muir trail wasn't as bad as I'd expected, but the unending 97 switchbacks were worse. With the rest of the descent on autopilot under a grin and bear it mentality, we nursed chafed butt-cheeks and exhausted leg muscles back to camp. The last two miles down from Lone Pine Lake to Whitney Portal was brutal. It felt familiar since we'd been over that part of trail three times prior, but was again so tantalizingly close to our goal that it seemed never ending. But when we finally reached our car and got back to the camp site, relief nearly overcame the pain. The thought of camping another night wasn't so enticing, so we packed up and drove into Lone Pine to get a hotel for the night. We probably could have saved some money if we'd planned it that way from the beginning, but the hot shower and soft bed were well worth it.\n\nThe next day, we drove through death valley to Badwater on our way to Vegas to celebrate, going from the highest peak in the lower 48 states to the lowest point in the western hemisphere in less than 24 hours. All in all, it was a pretty epic trip, especially considering we'd planned it in about a week. \n\nBelow's a link to a few pics from the trip. I wish I'd taken more.\n[http://imgur.com/a/MQ16p](http://imgur.com/a/MQ16p)\nMy apologies for any reddiquite or formatting errors - it's my first post.",

We totally had the same mentality coming down, just get the hell off the mountain. Having never been on the Whitney Portal side of things before, the last little bit where you can see the road/store... but hike endlessly past it and then finally back down via switchbacks was brutal, we were 75 miles into the trip and just wanted a burger and a beer (not to mention a shower).",

Got turned around a few times on the trail and realize that by the time I got to the peak of a 1700m mountain it would be 5:30pm. I really wanted to finish the hike so I pushed through, got to the peak, then immediately took my descent (didn't even enjoy the view, complete waste of time.)\n\nNeedless to say messed up my wayfinding on the way down twice and was well past 32km of walking with the end still being 8km out, walking on to 40km at that point, and it was 10pm and I was still in the woods by myself with over an hour to go. Thankfully had all-trails downloaded for the map but my gps signal was weak so it was hard to find my way back to a trail.\n\nThankfully I had a headlamp but the whole time I kept saying \"why didn't I turn around earlier!?\" Kept tripping on roots on the ground and could barely see where trails forked.\n\nMy ego got the best of me but thankfully I made it to the parking lot at about 11:30pm. Never been so happy to see a vehicle.\n\nPSA: Listen to your gut! If it's time to turn around, turn around.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm being a baby and maybe this whole subreddit loves hiking in the dark, but for me it was a terrifying experience to be alone in the woods at night hearing rustling in the brushes knowing there are cougars and bears rife in that area.",

I knew what I needed to complete the hike, but wasn't prepared for someone to slow the group down because of a twisted ankle.  To add insult to injury the other two didn't bring extra food and water.  I had an extra food and water, and  I started to feel a bit smug when I realized that  I was going to have to  share my water and food with the other two.  Needless to say, we ran out.    Lesson learned:  Prepare for a hike for the slowest/least prepared person in the group.  Now in group hikes, I do an 'inventory' check with each person (including myself) to make sure everyone is  adequately prepared for an emergency.  It could have gotten ugly if it was colder/and or raining.  Lucky for us, it was just a mild innocence.",

If the light is coming from a place close to where your eyes are, you‚Äôre less easily able to see the shadows (because they‚Äôre on thee opposite side of the object) so things might look flat when they‚Äôre not.

If i go on a week i plan for week +2 days. So for single day hike this means i will never ever leave without medpack, tarp, space blanket and aditional 24h of food and water.

Struck by tingling spidey senses for no apparent reason?\n\nI've been doing outdoorsy stuff all over the US since I was about old enough to walk, but for most of my life, camping, hiking, geocaching, etc. has been something I did with friends and family. \n\nThis summer has been the first time in my life that I've hiked and camped overnight alone (unless you count my dogs, who usually come alone for the adventure). I don't tend to go anywhere extremely remote and stick to established trails and dispersed camping sites. I always told people where I was going, carried the requisite supplies and survival gear, etc. And it's always been fine. \n\nLast week I did a late afternoon hike and everything seemed fine. I was hurrying back down the mountain, trying to make it to the trailhead before dark when I came around a switchback and instantly felt...weirded out. The woods were silent. No birds, no wind. My dogs seemed anxious and on edge: they stopped sniffing every fern and kept looking around, ears and tails up. The feeling got bad enough that I pulled the bear spray out of my side pouch and hand carried it the rest of the way.\n\nBecause I'm making this post and it doesn't end with my being mauled by a bear or murdered by a serial killer, you can probably deduce that nothing happened. But I keep thinking about it. I drove home feeling sort of ridiculous, like I'd overreacted and let my imagination run away with me. I kind of dismissed my dogs' behavior and either I was just reading too much into their body language or maybe they were just sensing my anxiety.\n\nI mentioned it to a few friends who also like the outdoors, and everyone has said they've had at least one similar experience. I'm kind of curious how often this happens to other people and if anything actually did happen (i.e., you later saw a cougar or a rock slide or...something?)",

It was in a valley with a dirt road going down the middle so hard to get lost so long as you could see the mountains still lol.  So I wasn't following any sort of set path.  The antelope kept about one hilltop ahead of me and every time I'd crest a hill they'd spot me and dart ahead to the next one. Was just a relaxing pleasant hike following them around. \n\nSuddenly upon rounding the top of one of the hills, the antelope herd charged back in my direction, breaking around where I was standing.  My first thought was \"whoah that was cool!\" But then I had this very distinct, unnerving feeling. \n\nThe hair stood up on my arms and back of my neck, and I just instantly felt this sense of \"I am being hunted.\"  Looked down and saw a nearly perfect mountain lion print, about the size of my palm, in the dirt between sagebrush.  Looked up and around and saw nothing... which doesn't mean much when it comes to big cats.\n\nI didn't have spray or anything for defense on me, since there usually aren't bears in that area and coyotes don't usually hassle people.  So I just grabbed my thermos and metal water bottle out of my bag and started loudly banging them together while singing and made my way back toward the roadway.  About 10 minutes of doing that suddenly felt significantly better, and no longer felt that \"I am prey\" feeling. \n\nWeird how something in our lizard brain is still really good at picking up those signs and dumping all of the panic hormones.",

I was coming down an open hillside heading toward some dense forest and every hair stood on end. I stop, clapped loudly, and yelled \"hey bear\" a couple times just to be on the safe side. When I entered the trees there was a fresh pile of scat on the trail - so fresh it was warm and the flies hadn't found it yet. As I'm staring at it a flock of birds flies up squawking about a 100 yds away. Nearly left my own scat pile.\n\nOnly other time I had a close encounter with a griz my senses gave me zero warning. Hiking along and a head pops up out of a bush maybe 50 yds in front of me. There I am standing and staring at a bear, standing and staring at me. Is seemed as confused as me, thank goodness, so I was able to back away until I had gone around a bend and it was out of sight. Collected myself, started making a lot of noise, and eventually heard it crashing through the brush running downhill away from the trail so I was able to get back to my campsite.\n\nHere in Colorado I rarely get unnerved. The last time I did it was because I could smell what I can only describe as \"animal funk\". Was in an area with lots of moose so kept an eye out but never saw anything.",

Many times miles from civilization. Never felt afraid at all not one bit, except for one time two years ago \n\nI was traveling from Colorado to California and decided to take the \"loneliest road in America\" hwy 50 across Nevada. To get a scope of how remote it can be at one point I saw a sign that said 128 miles to next gas station. About 40ish miles west of Ely Nevada I went off of that road onto a side gravel road and drove like 20 mins down that. I decided to camp there for the night \n\nI was surrounded by mountains but not directly. Basically it was vast and flat all around me in every direction for hundreds of yards before eventually hitting mountains. So I could see for a long way in every direction. There was no \"sneaking up on me\"\n\nDuring the day everything was completely fine, birds were chirping, I was walking around exploring, etc. No issues. Then it got dark....  It was about 10pm when it happened. Sound just disappeared. Immediately when it happened all my hair stood up and I had goosebumps all over my body. I started almost having what was like an anxiety attack and kept tapping my ears wondering why there was no sound. I was camping in my car and I looked around quickly and didn't see anything at all. Keep in mind if someone was coming I would be able to see them from well over a mile away. I dont know if my mind was playing tricks on me but way off in the distance I saw what I can only describe as a \"floating light\". It was too far away to really see anything but it was there. At first I thought it was maybe a hiker or camper, but then I realized in order for that to be true they would have had to pass me to get to where they are now so no way is it a person. During this there was still no sound, and when I saw the light I just felt pure fear. Not to sound cocky but I'm a big strong athletic guy so not much scares me and I kept telling myself I was crazy and nothing was wrong but I couldn't shake it. It was like pure primal fear. At one point I was shaking and I was so afraid I climbed in the back of my car and sat in the backseat (I have limo tint windows in back). I wanted so badly to look out the window but I was so afraid my body wouldn't let me. The no sound was messing with my mind and body. Technically I could have started my car and left but I was so afraid and civilization was so far away that I just sat there in the backseat shaking. At one point I just had this feeling that something was right outside my car looking at me but I was too afraid to look. I didn't have any service on my phone either. The last thing I remember is me just sitting there in my backseat terrified and the next thing I know i saw the sun coming up. Sound had returned and I heard birds chirping. That \"fear\" that washed over me was gone and I felt perfectly fine. I didn't even leave Immediately. I got up and cooked breakfast and hung out before leaving\n\nI've told this story on the internet a few times and most people always say that it was aliens or skinwalkers. Especially when I tell them about the floating light \"orb\". I however don't believe in stuff like that. I'm one of those people that believe there is a logical explanation for everything. But I cannot explain what happened that night. The absolute fear I felt all over my body. It was like I was a rabbit about to get eaten by wolves. I've never been so terrified in my life. I continue to hike and backpack with no fear and no issues ever since",

They were two males and were sort of taunting each other but not getting super physical. This is actually pretty ordinary for young inexperienced males. They were a safe distance so we did nothing about it except keep an eye on them as we worked. \n\nWe broke for lunch and it was mine and another guy's turn to watch the bears. At one point as we were eating and conversing the bears switched from posturing at each other to a mild if not superficial fight. That's when ordinary stopped. \n\nAfter a couple minutes of some back and forth between the bears they both suddenly stopped, gave each other a bit of a look, and then completely bolted in opposite directions. It was just so bizarre that it completely unnerved me. We all commented about how weird it was. \n\nThe next day we had free so a few of us decided to go exploring. We headed off in the direction one of the bears took thinking we'd maybe get a few lucky pictures to send back to impress our friends; the sun had been behind the bears the previous day. \n\nWe followed the tracks of one of the bears for awhile and eventually remarked at how the tracks never seemed to change gait. Then we found the bear, dead. \n\nSo here's the thing about polar bears, they're hot blooded. So much that in the summer they can overheat from exertion. We didn't perform an autopsy or anything, but there were no obvious sounds, and from the tracks this bear ran full put for at least six kilometers. So, presumably, something spooked two adult male polar bears enough that one of them ran itself to death. \n\nDidn't sleep much the rest of the trip.",

We were in what was called a nature park, not quite a reserve, but a suburban 200 acre natural area ranging over a hillside. It has about 3 miles of trails through grassland and pine forest. There's quite a bit of denser forested area with streams and no trails. The park is large enough to support deer and some small black bear. There are no dogs allowed and absolutely no hunting. It's popular with birders. \n\nIt was about 9:30 a.m. as we were heading up back the hill toward the park entrance. We heard a barred owl hoot. It was the *who-cooks-for-you? who-cooks-for-you-all?* call. We immediately heard a response call of the same notes, except it was not quite right. We heard the owl hoot again and that one was totally normal. Next, we heard the uncanny one. It sounded like an imitation that was good, but off just enough to realize that probably wasn't an actual owl. Then came the owl's perfect hoot again. This was repeated maybe 5 times, each time the uncanny one was less convincing. Next we heard one of the weirdest sound I've ever heard in nature. It was a low, deep, pitiful moan. We looked around and there were a few other people around but nobody paid any attention to the strangeness unfolding in the forest. This whole thing probably took less than 3 minutes.\n\nWhen we got home, we explained what we heard to our teenagers. The kids and I each looked through animal sound libraries. We had no luck until one kid came to me with a recording and asked if it was what we heard. It was! It was a recording of young black bear moaning after being frightened and reaching safety. Apparently, it's not common and fairly distinctive. Black bears can frighten easily though.\n\nMy question was, and still is, who or what was mimicking an owl, and is that what scared the black bear so badly it fled and moaned?",

There was only about a half a mile from my site to the dead end of the road.  There is nothing left past this campsite I was in.  As I set up camp, cars would pass and shortly they'd pass back by on their way back out.  Just before dusk, one ATV and one truck passed and they never came back by my site.  Knowing there was nothing left after my campsite, I was a bit spooked by their presence.  So I listened to my gut, got my gun and sat it next to me on the table should they show up with nefarious intentions.  They never did, and I was fine.",

It happened so fast that I didn‚Äôt get scared.  Thankfully, it spooked easily.  A large black bear showed up about an hour later and it was aggressive and not scared at all.

Once out of earshot we all agreed we were going to get jacked in the middle of the night at that site.

One of my favorite hunting spots was a low logging road that followed a stream back into the woods about 2 miles to a very secluded meadow. \n\nOne evening, when it was time to stop for the day, I decided to hike straight through the woods to another access road that I knew was about 1/2 mile above me rather than do the full 2 miles back to the truck. About half way out, I stumbled upon a very large, very think cluster of dead trees that I had to hike through to reach my pick up point. I got to about the middle of the grove with my eyes mostly closed while getting poked in the face by branches, so I decided to duck down to try to find the best way out. That was when I noticed that not only were the trees bare on their lower 3 feet or so, they were also covered in dark black moss and lichen, and there were old bones all over the ground. The bones were disarticulated, and covered in various mosses and dirt, but there was a lot of them. \n\nAs soon as I saw that, I realized I was stuck in the middle of a creepy death zone in the woods, with the sun rapidly setting and about 1/4 mile before the safety of the truck and I got super creeped out. I put my gun on my back, my arms up in front of me, and smashed my way through the trees as quickly as possible. There are lots of cougars in the area, and I assume the bones were from their hunting activity, but it was still one of the scariest events I‚Äôve ever had in nature. I don‚Äôt believe in supernatural or paranormal stuff, but stuck in those trees with the dark closing in I got some super bad vibes, and I‚Äôve never been back there since. \n\nSide note: A few years before, and further up that same logging road I had a very close encounter with a mother bear and her three cubs. They came down a side trail almost right up to me while I was sitting, hidden, under a tree. The mom got within about 10 feet of me before she realized what I was, and ran off into the woods leaving me lone with the cubs, who quickly followed. That was unnerving in a different way, but comparing the two events, I would take the bears any day. \n\nTLDR: I stumbled into a creepy death zone in the woods that was scarier than bears.",

                    "Content": "Happened to me a short while ago. I was hiking in the woods around my city using a hiking app and at some point, when I reached a medium-sized pond, it led me into‚Ä¶.well, nothing. It said there was supposed to be a trail leading around the pond but there just wasn‚Äôt. If you looked really closely there was the very last remnant of one, but it was completely overgrown. And when I say completely, I mean completely. But I‚Äôm stubborn so I decided to continue where the app led me, surely it would take me back to a still existing trail at some point in the near future.\n\nFirst weird thing that happened was that the frogs in the pond just suddenly went silent. One moment they were really loud, the next there was nothing. But I thought they probably just stopped making noise because of my presence. But that‚Äôs when the weird feeling kinda started creeping in.\n\nBut again, I‚Äôm stubborn, so I made my way into the thicket regardless. The further I went in the more unnerved I started to feel, especially when I eventually found a plastic bottle just lying around in this really densely overgrown part of woodland. It made me wonder who tf else was creeping around this place and why.\n\nThen I thought I heard the noise a phone makes when you get a message. My phone is always on silent. At that moment I probably looked calm on the outside but I was kinda panicking on the inside. But, same as your story, nothing ended up happening and the app did finally lead back to a well established trail. And the more distance I brought between myself and that area the more the feeling started to fade. The memory of the feeling stayed for quite a while though, if that makes sense. I usually try to go hiking every opportunity I get but after that I had no desire to do so for a bit.\n\nThat‚Äôs probably also partly due to the fact that the story doesn‚Äôt actually end there. When I came out of the woods I ran into what I thought was a group of other hikers. Until they came up to me and asked me if I was a regular in these woods. And then shoved a photo in my face and asked me if I had happened to see this guy who was apparently the cousin of one of the members of the group. They hadn‚Äôt been able to get in touch with him for two days and his car had been abandoned at the edge of the forest. For anyone wondering: I hadn‚Äôt seen him. And while I don‚Äôt actually think these things are connected it was‚Ä¶.weird.\n\nI still think that I was probably just overreacting to being in the middle of this thicket where it was obviously darker and more claustrophobic and I‚Äôm not even sure if I imagined the sound of the phone or not. Very likely my mind was playing tricks on me that day because I was already unnerved. But I‚Äôm surely not going back to the area around that pond again regardless.",

This dog was awesome though. Professionally trained, very calm demeanor, unflappable and gentle. I decided to take him on a short (leashed) hike in a woods along the river just outside of my town that I used to frequent in my teens and knew well.\n\nAll was going well. He was happy, but well behaved. No other people on the trail. Suddenly the dog froze and had his tail and ears up. He didn't bark, but put himself in front of me on the trail, right up against my legs, and refused to let me go any further. I held on to his leash and scanned the woods but couldn't see or hear anything. Like, nothing. No birds or bugs, no leaves rustling, nothing. I've never been afraid of being alone in the woods, but I decided that whatever was worrying the 85 lb Australian Shepherd was nothing I wanted to test, so I trusted him and we went back the way we came. He looked behind us for a while, but went back to normal by the time we got to the trail head, and never did that again while I had him.\n\nI live in western Ohio. No mountain lions or bears here. There are coyotes, but they're very timid, and never come close to town or bother humans at all. A stray dog would have barked or gowled. In the years since, there has been a lot of crime and drug issues out there. Even a dead body found. I've quit going there altogether. The only thing I can think of is that someone he didn't like the smell of was hiding out there and probably up to no good.",

In the parking lot, at a trailhead I used, there is a monument to a general killed in the fighting and a plaque that tells about a Georgia regiment that took heavy casualties during the fighting. I didn't think much of it other than it is an interesting bit of history to the area. The hike out to white rocks was fine. Uneventful, enjoyed the view at the overlook. On my return, something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention off the trail and as I turned,  I swear it was a person looking at me. It startled me to the point I actually gasped and almost fell over (the trail is very rocky) when I looked back up, I saw nothing. That was it. I was done. Time to haul ass back to the car. I'm sure it was just my mind playing a trick on me. A very cruel trick. But I have hiked that area only one other time and had the feeling I was being watched for a portion of that hike as well.

To this day, I'm convinced I was being stalked by it that night.\n\nI had the same feeling when we were outside of Flagstaff, AZ. The next morning I woke up and let the dogs out, and they started obsessing over a tree. I go over to the tree and look up, and there is a bloody deer leg balancing on a lower branch. Mountain lion behavior for sure.\n\nI 100% believe in a sixth sense because of experiences like this. However... I felt this up in WA on a remote trail, picked up a stick and a couple rocks for self defense and ran across a hiker around the next bend. I dropped the rocks and pretended to be using the stick as a walking stick, so I wouldn't seem like an idiot or come off as a potential threat. Felt like an idiot for a few miles.\n\nI've run across moose and bear without issues. One time when out in our truck camper we had bear paw prints below the window, as if he was standing on his hind legs and looking in at us. Regardless, our dogs didn't make a peep. Not sure if we all slept through it or what. No idea how the three dogs who normally wake for any bump in the night could.\n\nI've never seen more snakes in my life than when I spent the summer of covid in Cottonwood, AZ. Every time I went for a run, I saw at least half a dozen diamondbacks. They're pretty tame as far as rattlers go. I've stepped on one and it didn't bite.

That should have been my sign to turn back. It was a 10 mile loop so not a short jaunt. It was eerily quiet but I kept smelling extremely strong animal musk at random points... like OK I might be in some mountain lion's territory right now. I always carry bear spray but that left me uneasy. \n\nAnother time felt strongly there was a bear very close by in the thickets, but could not see them. I could hear the movement, super loud sounds of thicket being trampled by a lumbering large animal. Generally coming in my direction.  It sounded too loud to be deer and I'm not sure I'd expect deer to be in the raspberry thickets like that. Bears, yes. \n\nLastly, the first time I ever went camping as an adult, with my boyfriend. I couldn't fall asleep and heard footsteps. Bipedal. Not a deer. Sounded extremely human. Panicked and woke him up, we shined our lights around but could see nothing yet both heard the steps getting closer. Until we finally caught something moving in our flashlight beams. It was a HUGE cricket and somehow the way it was hopping sounded just like people. I was so damn spooked I couldn't sleep after that üò´ to this day I find it hard to sleep when camping, my brain hears too many sounds and amplifies them. I prefer day hikes. Oh and the best part was when we got home the next day his mom said \"there is an escaped prisoner, a murderer, that police think may be hiding in those woods you camped in. Saw it on the news!\" ü´†\n\nAnother time, it was a beautiful weekend, graduation season, lots of people out at a popular state park celebrating. Picnics everywhere. I put my pack on and realize I've forgotten bear spray. I'm in the west north carolina Smokies. My heart sinks.... there's food EVERYWHERE surely the bears are gonna smell it even if it's not me. Well I don't see any on the super crowded parts of the trails but as I continue on the longer path I only pass an occasional hiker maybe every 30 min. I'm coming up a steep wooded climb and  round a corner. I've just passed a couple coming the opposite way as me... so they've already been through this side of the corner. Just say hi nothing else. Well I come around the bend and startle a bear who was enjoying a berry snack on the side of the trail. He's off to the side of me. I decide to just speed walk past then make a mad dash downhill because while he was startled, he was not afraid. He just stood up real tall still holding berries, like he wanted to get a better look. Might have been a female, really don't know. Just seemed tall as heck, although I'm also petite. I'm not sure how the hikers I passed didn't see it and warn me. I'm like of course the one day I would have really liked to have a can of spray.. it's when I forgot it.  I'm just glad there were plenty of berries üò©",

I was getting to the end of my night photography session and had actually already packed up one of my cameras and was just finishing the last few photos when I heard footsteps near me. Very clearly. I couldn't see anyone or anything near me, but I was so freaked out. I immediately grabbed my camera, put it around my neck, threw my pack on,  and carried my tripod with me. I'm glad that I didn't have to fight anyone/anything off with my tripod. I still had the feeling that something was off when I got to my car. I had to bend down and check under the car, hurry and throw my suff in the trunk, and check the back seat to make sure no one was in my car. Then I jumped in, locked the doors, and blitzed out of there. Writing about this takes me right back to that intense creeped out feeling that I had hearing those distinct, clear footsteps.\n\nThat was the night that I was most unnerved, but there have been many other times when there has been an actual reason to be creeped out that haven't just been my overactive imagination.",

Big ones.\n\nOk whatever.

I figure it's just another hiker that stepped on some sticks looking for their own site to set up. I lay my head back down and close my eyes.\n\nSuddenly I hear whatever it is was start barreling down the trail in my direction. Whatever it is it's *massive*. I can hear the weight behind it from the way tree limbs are snapping.\n\nI hear it stop at the little cut between the main trail and my campsite. That's not good.\n\nThe sniffing and snorting is getting louder and louder as this thing gets closer. It's huge. \n\nI say some \"yo bear\"s, starting quietly because I don't want to startle it and slowly get louder until I'm all but yelling. It couldn't care less. It's getting closer. Huffing and sniffing. Until it's within feet of my tent. \n\nI decided that I've got zero chance if im stuck wrapped up in my tiny one person tent, so I'm at least going to fully open the zipper in one swoop and hope it sees me and leaves. \n\nI work up the nerve as this thing feels like it's right on top of me, *ziiiiiiiip*, I look out..... \n\n... cow. \n\nA curious cow, probably wanting to know who was in its favorite bedding spot. \n\nI said \"fuck you\" right to her stupid cow face, zippered back up, and went back to bed.

I saw a flash in the woods,  then heard some splashing. I could hear something bigger than a typical critter walking in the water, but my view was obscured by brush. Thinking it was a deer, I got closer to try to get a glimpse through the bushes. Suddenly, I hear some crashing in the brush coming towards me...and panting. Do bears pant? Deer definitely do not pant! I hurriedly backtracked and yelled out,  \"Hey, bear!\" just in case. Yeah, it was a hunting dog. I felt so foolish, and was so glad the owner wasn't near to hear me.

I quickly chose a little clear spot by a creek, threw up my pop-up tent, and crawled in. The storm continued to get worse, but the tent was pretty good, so I had some cold dinner & tried to go to sleep. Later, in the dark, I woke up. It was still pouring, but my tent seemed to be surrounded by rustling, groaning, and other weird sounds. I didn't like it. I didn't know what was going on, and I couldn't figure out what was making those sounds. But I got a feeling I was in the wrong place. It was just a feeling, but I couldn't shake it. I couldn't sleep. Finally I got out of my sleeping bag. Since it was still raining and I didn't want to get my clothes wet, I stripped off except for my boots. Then I unzipped the tent, ran out, grabbed the whole tent, still deployed,  with all my stuff in it by a couple of the pop-up poles, and started running around in the pitch-black dark in the rain, stark naked except for my boots, looking frantically for a spot that 'felt better'. I found one about a hundred yards away, threw the tent down, crawled in, dried off, and had a great sleep for the rest of the night. I don't know what it was about that particular site, but I'd give anything to have a video of that little escapade.",

Looked back and forth and saw they were coyotes on either side of the road. They were curious about me but didn't seem to care. I took a deep breath and ran right through them.",

I dropped into a little dip, like a gully, and was climbing up through some thick pinyon/juniper forest, when I just hit a weird spot. \n\nThe trees were thick and close, but mostly had bare gray branches near the ground, under green tops.  Usually they are dense and you can't see any farther than  the next tree, but now I could see, but only sort of, thinly through gray branches almost like a haze. There was NO undergrowth, just this crunchy shale, but mostly it was suddenly very, very quiet.  No birdsong, no wind, no grasshoppers popping, no nothing.  Noticeably, suddenly, completely dead quiet. \n\nA moment after I realized that, I was hit out of nowhere with a rush of pure fear.  Just dread, the kind you feel when you are watching real shit hit the fan, whe realize you are falling and miss your grab for support, or when you realize that other car isn't stopping.  Not like a jump scare, either, like dread. \n\nI started looking everywhere at once, trying to see what had me so spooked. The fear was so intense, sudden, and real, it had to BE something real. Right? I'm looking for rattlesnakes, cougars, charging range bulls, something about to fall on me, Bigfoot, whatever, and there was nothing. \n\nBut, even after I saw nothing to be afraid of, the fear stayed.  I was really worked up, breathing hard, clutching my bow hard (almost always have one of my bows), and spinning around, checking everywhere. I just STAYED scared. In fact, it started to rise to panic level, I started to twitch and had an almost u controllable urge to run.  Just flee. \n\nSomehow, I did not.  I kept my shit together and started walking slowly through the trees up the hill, head on a swivel. The whole time, I was just freaking out, feeling like I was about to be attacked, or hit by falling rocks any second. In about a hundred and twenty yards, I mounted another little steep rise onto a flattish rocky basalt field.  Here the trees opened, and I broke out into the open, into the sunshine.  \n\nThe sounds came back; the clicking of grasshopper wings,  their popping in the dry balsamroot, birds, wind, all the little wild lives, and the feeling simply subsided, fading back into normalcy.  My heart slowed, the hair on my neck went down, the prickles left my spine and belly, and after a short time I was giving the strange episode no thought at all.  It was gone from me completely, and it didn't occur to me that I should be worried it would come.back.",

I started shooting at it (albeit a. 22) and it darted faster than anything I had seen. I'm not sure if I hit it or not. I left my 2 squirrels there as I'm sure that's what attracted it to me, and I walked very slowly and on high alert back to the house. I was an absolute mess. \n\n2nd story was I was in West Virginia in my mid 20s. I was trout fishing along the Cranberry River and I walked in the woods to pee. I stepped in the woods and immediately got overwhelmed with fear and it triggered my flight or fight and I immediately left. Not sure why. That was unusual.",

Nice refuge but was really cold. \n\nNext day, did the via ferrata bocchette which was spectacular in snow (had good weather, next to no wind and mostly sunny) arriving at Rifugio Tosa Pedrotti which was nice and cozy. \n\nNext day, back to Rifugio Brentei (the beds were absolutely terrible, you just sink straight into the mattress, couldn't sleep much as there was no back support). Next date returned to Rifugio Tuckett through the SOSAT via ferrata and buy this time, 95% of the snow has melted.  Food was delicious at the Rifugios.",
