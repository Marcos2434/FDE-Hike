Safety gear is strongly recommended when hiking mountains with increased exposure.\n\nI was confident in my ability to safely hike this mountain at that time, otherwise I would not have done it. I was careful with every step I took, and every gust of wind I felt.\n\nAlso, I was using a GoPro with wide view enabled (or super wide, can't remember), so it looks more exposed in this video than it does to the naked eye.\n\nI encourage everyone to get out and enjoy the outdoors because it is a beautiful, wild, and wonderful place. But, I do not encourage going for a hike or climb that will put your life in serious danger, unless you have some safety equipment that you know how to use.  Thank you all again and stay safe!",

Someone I know died last summer and didn’t have an inReach or similar.  \n\nLast year I also had a separate friend who had just hiked glacier NP so in decent shape get into trouble on a easy Phoenix hike w me and a group and temps were 78-88F.  They got into severe dehydration from: having just flown in (plane’s dehydrate), some but not excessive wine the night before, coffee before the hike (both diuretics) and the big kicker they were used to humid environment and didn’t drink enough. Ended the hike w a full extra water bottle but went from talking to uncontrolled cramps, no sight, couldn’t talk within 10 mins.  Lucky we were at the ER in 15. 2 liters of IV and on their feet. \n\nThe following might have gotten you as you were drinking:  one month after the above I did south rim to river to south rim in May (note I have done a dozen R2R or S2River2S) but started at 4:30am to stay below 90F at the bottom.  Having experienced the two life/hike changing incidents above I was sure to have enough water and drink it.  What happened to me was I pushed beyond my current fitness level to get past the devils corkscrew before it got to hot.  While I was drinking a lot my stomach shut down and at 3 mile house all that water I was “drinking” came back up.  So it wasn’t getting into my system. Luckily I had the shade of the shelter and spent an hour sipping water and then took it real slow.  So even drinking enough your gut can shut down on you.  \n\nMaybe you and I can go on a redemption trip!",

We ran out of water about 1/2 mile from the trailhead. It was hot in the mid 90s. We finally made it to our car. We went to showers that cost $1.50 for three minutes (in 1989) and had dinner at the Tovar Hotel. We then drove back to Sierra Vista. That was a hard day.

Once you get it, you are prone to it for the rest of your life, and no one really knows why.

When I have a canyon trip, I train intensively for at least three months, with at least five training hikes. \n\nAnd I go in March/April, when the hottest I’ve gotten is 85. \n\nI hope that this was a good wake up call about the seriousness of the canyon.",

We did meet a number of hikers that were doing a R2R2R which we thought was crazy. We did have to help a couple of hikers at the end of our hike to make it back out of the canyon.

Knew it was dehydration, spent a few mins sucking down as much water/electrolytes as I could. Went away after 10-15 mins.  About an hour later, cramp in right leg. Knew that was a bad sign. About 6000 ft, first signs of altitude sickness, too. Stopped, hydrated, it went away. Then, both legs at same time. At which point, too far to go back down, can only keep going up.\n\nFirst 7 miles took 6 hours. The next 2.4 miles took almost 5 hours. Severe altitude sickness. The trail had been completely wiped out by shock pack rockslides. All that was left, was a near straight scramble up fallen rock, for 1500-200o vertical feet. Except, I could only do 100 ft at time, before nausea and dizziness became too much. I'd have to sit, for two to five minutes, until my head cleared. Then, scramble another 100 feet, and sit.   \n\n\nNever made the summit. All three of us decided to quit at 8400 ft, at the Tram station. Glad we did. A poor soul died a little farther up, towards the summit, that day. His body was covered by a thin blanket and some rocks. If I had seen that, in the depths of my worst altitude sickness, I might have panicked. \n\nI remember thinking \"Arrogant fuck, you(myself) forgot that Mother Nature wants to kill you, at any time\"",
