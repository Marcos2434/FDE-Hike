# FDE-Hike

## Plan

1. We'll call the reddit api / website to get posts from the region / location / hike name and their headlines for key examples of what to expect in the hike.
    1. We'll use key words (extracted by Natural Language Processing, NLP) in the headlines / bodies / comments to display information about what to expect on the hike: (i.e. Cool bridges, snow, mortal accidents and similar).
    2. We'll use reddit labels and popularity (upvotes, comments and such) to recommend or select the best hike.
2. We'll develop a mathematical formula for the hike popularity / best experience based on the initial dataset and the scraped data.
3. With the data we've collected we'll find the similarity between the hikes. -> ?
4. Hypothesise, then implement and then compare performance loss or improvement from a relational database to a graph database.
